          This plan is built around small neighborhoods, bike-friendly routes, and long afternoons near the
          canals. We’ll stay flexible, keep mornings quiet, and lean into local markets, museums, and studios
          that feel distinctly Dutch.

          The focus is on light logistics with time for spontaneous photo walks. Every city stop has a
          balance of architecture, food, and space to breathe.
